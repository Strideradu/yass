Howto compile x64 binaries for windows using VC++2005 Express :
---------------------------------------------------------------



(1) you need to install 

(a) Visual Studio Express 2005 (aka version 8), 
    that only provides the WIN32 compiler 

(b) the Microsoft Platform SDK 2003 (tried with the current R2) 
    that provides a x64 compiler.

both are "free" : the Platform SDK 2003 "R2" needs a genuine XP licence.

---

(2) Go to  "Start" -> "All programs" ->
           "Microsoft Platform SDK for Windows Server 2003 ..." -> 
           "Visual Studio Registration" -> 
           "Register PSDK Directories with Visual Studio"

(3) (a) Go to  "Start" -> "All programs" ->
             "Microsoft Platform SDK for Windows Server 2003 ..." ->
             "Open Build Environment ..." -> 
        And  choose the correct x64 platform needed (for example x64 XP retail)

    (b) a terminal should start, 
        from it go to the correct Visual Studio IDE Directory 
        (command line rulez): 

    cd .. ; 
    cd Microsoft Visual Studio 8 ; 
    cd Common7 ; 
    cd IDE ;

    (c) then start

    "VCExpress.exe /useenv", 

    it should start with the correct 
    "Tools"->"Options"->"Projects and Solutions"->"VC++ Directories" 
    linking the "Microsoft Platform SDK 2003"



(4 and End) 

   (a) now open the "VisualStutio2005" Project, 
       choose the correct "x86" -> "x64" parameter, 
       (you dont care about the Win32 platform that is 
        unremovable from VCExpress, the compiler is now 
        correctly set to the WIN64)

   (b)  Compile the project in VS2005 : ("F7" shortcut) 

(5) dont forget to unregister (see step 2) and restart VCStudio
    if you need to use the original VCStudioExpress WIN32 compiler 
    after that ...
